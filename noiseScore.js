/**
 * noiseScore.js
 *
 * "Real vs. Noise" verdict — synthesizes the active signals and price
 * target into one plain-English read: is this genuine conviction worth
 * acting on, or noise/incomplete evidence to wait out?
 *
 * badge/headline are classification, not prose — kept fully rule-based so
 * they stay deterministic and auditable (other code keys off exact headline
 * strings). Only the `reasoning` paragraph is optionally rewritten by Claude
 * for better prose; the rule-based sentence is always computed first and
 * used verbatim if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY isn't set or the API call fails.
