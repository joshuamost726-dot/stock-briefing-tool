/**
 * signalExplainer.js
 *
 * Turns one signal's rule-based headline/detail into a short, plain-English
 * explanation via Claude (claude-haiku-4-5) — same fallback philosophy as
 * noiseScore.js's verdict rewrite: if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is unset or the call
 * fails, falls back to the original headline rather than breaking anything.
 *
 * Callers should only invoke this for signals that actually have data to
 * explain — a "no data" signal's headline is already about as simple as it
 * gets, so there's nothing worth spending a Claude call on.
 *
 * POSITION CONTEXT: when detail.positionContext is present (insider buying
 * and institutional buying are currently the only two signals that can
 * supply one — see signalPriceContext.js), this isn't just told to restate
 * the price gap, it's explicitly asked to REASON about what it means for
 * someone holding at that cost basis. That reasoning genuinely depends on
 * direction and magnitude — "smart money paid more than you" reads very
 * differently from "smart money paid less than you," and neither is simply
 * good or bad on its own — so the system prompt spells out how to think
 * about each case rather than leaving Claude to guess a framing.
